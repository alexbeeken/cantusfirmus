Cantus Firmus Generator
===============

This is the refactored version of an app that outputs an array that is intended to play a cantus firmus inside of Sonic Pi. A cantus firmus is a series of whole notes used in strict counterpoint writing. The ultimate goal of this project is to randomly generate a complete composition and play it in sonic pi directly.
